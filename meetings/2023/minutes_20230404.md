## Previous Action Points
- Administrative: call for volunteers update
- Action items from ROSCon 2022 Maritime Birds of a Feather update

## General Business
Since attendance was low we decided to just go through the kanban and keep it short

**Review kanban** <br>
On marine specific message standardization:
- The [prototype messages](https://github.com/ros-maritime/maritime_interfaces) do not seem to be commonly used (Arjo)
- apl-ocean-engineering's [hydrographic_msgs](https://github.com/apl-ocean-engineering/marine_msgs) repo is being used more frequently. 
- It was considered to keep using their repo as they seem to maintain it. 

**Promotion & Communication** <br>
It was considered to check out discord for promoting these meetings (and perhaps have them there?)

Arjo suggested considering to have less frequent meetings. We will consider options during the next meeting of winding down or not.
