# ROS Maritime Robotics Working Group

This document defines the scope and governance of the Working Group (WG).

Mission: To unite, create and upgrade generic maritime robotics solutions that can be easily deployed in maritime robots. 

Scope: ROS packages related to maritime robotics specificities of any robotics field: control, simulation, drivers... All maritime robots types are included, whether they are USV (Ummaned Surface Vehicle), AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), underwater manipulators...

## Subprojects

This Working Group maintains the following Subprojects.
Its meetings and membership are largely focused on the direction, design, and work on the projects.

### Subproject List

The following projects, listed under Repositories, are affiliated with the Working Group.

Those listed under References are unaffiliated resources for reference. The references lists are not meant to be exhaustive.

* Communication
  * Description: Packages for underwater network wireless communication.
  * Motive: Since underwater communications relies on acoustic waves, there are some specificities regarding these types of waves that should be taken into account during data transmission.
  * Repositories
    * Suggestions...
  * References: 
    * [ns UAN](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/uan.html)
    * [WHOI `ros_acomms`](https://git.whoi.edu/acomms/ros_acomms)

* Common Messages
  * Description: Specific ROS messages for maritime robotics.
  * Motive: There are maritime robotics sensors that give specific types of messages.
  * Unique Repo
    * Assist the development of [UW APL Hydrographic Messages](https://github.com/apl-ocean-engineering/hydrographic_msgs)

* Drivers
  * Description: Documentation and index for underwater and surface vehicles sensors and actuators drivers.
  * Motive: There are specific components used only for maritime robotics, which requires drivers to interact with them. Although, there already is an ROS organization to develop ROS drivers, so instead of developing inside this organization, we would use it just to have an index describing maritimate focused ROS drivers.
  * Unique Repo
    * **[Proposal]** ROS Maritime Robotics Drivers Index
    * **[Proposal]** Sonar and radar drivers
  * References: 
    * [ROS Drivers](https://github.com/ros-drivers)

* Documentation
  * Description: Documentation and index for maritime robotics packages and organizations.
  * Motive: There are already many organizations and repos for maritime robotics. It is important to map what it is already developed in the area as well as make tutorials for newcomers or people that want to contribute with maritime robotics development.
  * Repositories
    * **[Proposal]** ROS Maritime Robotics Documentation Index
    * **[Proposal]** ROS Maritime Robotics Tutorials
  * References: 
    * Marine-specific software architecture
      * [COLA2](https://iquarobotics.com/cola2): ROS and Gazebo

* Dynamic Model
  * Description: Packages related to estimation and iteration of maritime robots models.
  * Motive: Maritime robots dynamical models have to take into account buoyancy, hydrodynamics... Therefore some packages regarding math models are needed. 
  * Repositories
    * **[Proposal]** Maritime vehicle model estimation based experiments
      * Use control, pose and velocity bags and URDF to estimate the Fossen equation of motion parameters
    * **[Proposal]** Maritime vehicle model iterator
      * Use vehicle equations of motion to predict the robot's next position and velocity. This can be used with localization and control algorithms.

* Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC)  
  * Description: Packages for GNC of maritime robots.
  * Motive: There are some controls and tasks specifics to maritime robots, such as thruster control allocation, surveillance, vessels' handling of tides...
  * Repositories
    * **[Proposal]** Thruster manager
  * References: 
    * [Plankton thruster manager](https://github.com/Liquid-ai/Plankton/blob/master/uuv_control/uuv_thruster_manager/src/uuv_thrusters/thruster_manager.py)
 
* Localization
  * Description: Packages to localize maritime vehicles.
  * Motive: Underwater and surface vehicles have a lot of differences regarding the sensors they can use for localizing themselves. GPS does not work underwater, as well as lidars or electromagnetic waves for long distances... But acoustic waves work pretty well, so underwater localization rely more on sensors like DVL and Sonar, that uses acoustic waves to measure distance and velocity.  
  * Repositories:
    * **[Proposal]**: Multilateration of acoustic beacons

    * [Fuse Localization](https://github.com/uos/mesh_navigation)
    * [MagNav](https://www.gpsworld.com/us-air-force-to-explore-navigating-with-magnetism/)

* Perception
  * Description: Packages for perception algorithms for maritime robotics.
  * Motive: Since there are different sensors such as sonars, there is a need to process this data to obtain information. Moreover, it can be created some common structures detection.
  * Repositories:
    * **[Proposal]**: Common Maritime Environments Detections (buoys, valves, pipes...)
    * **[Proposal]**: Fusion of sonar and camera data
  * References: 
    * Suggestions...
   
* Robots
  * Description: Packages with maritime robots and structures.
  * Motive: All the software being developed shall have not only unit tests but integration tests, so robots and structures shall be developed for this purpose. These shall include vcstool for specifying packages to be used with the robot as well as ros_ign_bridge to test it in simulation.
  * Repositories
    * **[Proposal]** Hover type UW vehicle
    * **[Proposal]** Torpedo shaped UW vehicle
    * **[Proposal]** USV
    * **[Proposal]** Intervention UW vehicle

    * Torpedo Shaped UW vehicle [LRAUV](https://github.com/osrf/lrauv/)

* Simulation
  * Description: Documentation and index for maritime robotics Gazebo plugins.
  * Motive: There is no need to mix ROS code with simulation, also there is already some maritime robotics development in Ignition, so it is a good thing to contribute to ign-gazebo repo instead of creating other in this organization.
  * Repositories
    * **[Proposal]** Maritime Robotics Gazebo Plugins Index
    * **[Proposal]** Wave Simulation (repo shall be in ign-plugins)
    * **[Proposal]** Acoustics Simulation (repo shall be in ign-plugins) (Include salinity and temperature effects)
